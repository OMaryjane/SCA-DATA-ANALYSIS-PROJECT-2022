# SCA-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT-2022  
The business of an App store is one that creates an opportunity for uses to access apps while generating income from the service provided through any of the medium or a combination in some cases; free, In-app purchases or paid for.
In this project, I gave an overview from the Data gotten from Google Play store by Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the names of apps, categories they fall under, types, number of installs, reviews, ratings, versions released and dates even.
I gave insights to the developers on areas to improve on, correct and take note of in order to generate more income. The key question I answered was; What category of app or app generated the highest income and How can more apps be generating more income than they already are making.
